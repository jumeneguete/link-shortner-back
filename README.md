<h1 align="center"> Link-shortner</h1>

This is an API for an application that takes in an url and gives back a shortned url to the user that redirects it to the original one. <br/>
I'm focused here to use JWT for authentication and Redis for in-memory store, used as cache.  <br/>
It is still being developed... soon it will be completed.  <br/>
