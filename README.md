<h1 align="center"> Link-shortner</h1>

This is an API for an application that takes in an url and gives back a shortner url to the user that redirects it to the original url.
I'm focuse here to use JWT for authentication and Redis for in-memory store used as cache.
It is still being developed... soon it will be completed.
